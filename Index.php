  <h2 class="unixtutorial"> Unix Tutorial </h2>
  <p>
    Welcome to our UNIX tutorial website, here are multiple guides on how to get started using and flourishing with UNIX. 
    The sidebar contains a full list of each section and a general idea on what each section contains. 
    Iâ€™d recommend that on your first view of this site you should start at our first section which would give a solid introduction on what to expect from the site's general format of the other sections!
  </p>

  
  <h2> Audience </h2>
  <p>
    This site is for all who are interested in UNIX. Are you new and wanting to learn how to use UNIX? Start on the introduction unit and work your way through. 
    A grizzled UNIX Vet? Use the site as a reference, each unit has plenty of helpful code examples!
  </p>

  <h2> What should I know?</h2>
  <p>
    You can come into this site with as much or as little Unix experience as you want. At the beginning of each section there is an expected knowledge blurb, which tells you what subjects are expected for you to know when starting that section.
